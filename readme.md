# Telecom Customer Churn ELT (SQL-First)

This project is an **open-source ELT pipeline** that ingests a CSV dataset (e.g., [Telecom Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullah0a/telecom-customer-churn-insights-for-analysis)), stages it in Postgres, cleans and anonymizes sensitive data with **SQL transformations**, and makes the processed data available for reporting in **Metabase**.
